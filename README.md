# Kyori - Yet another string distance algorithm

In Japanese, the word for “distance” is 距離 pronounced as **kyori** (きょり).

## Install

Installing the library is simple, just run the following command.

```bash
npm install kyori
```

## Usage

Using the library is also straightforward. First, you must include the kyori module, then execute the `kyoriDistance` function.

```javascript
const kyori = require('kyori');

kyori('foo', 'foo') // => this return 0, which means the strings are identical
```
